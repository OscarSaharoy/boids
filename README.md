# boids
Flocking Simulation in Unity based on this paper: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/

The boids fly around, interacting to stay flying together in a flock. The "BinGrid" is an array of linked lists which divide the space into chunks so that the algorithm can run at closer to linear time.
Hopefully I'll be able to implement something like this in js next so it's interactable.

(this is just the assets folder of a unity project)
